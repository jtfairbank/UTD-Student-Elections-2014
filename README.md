Building Bridges
===============================================================================

A website for my super great sister Nancy Fairbank, and her student government coalition Building Bridges.  Great luck in the 2014 Spring elections at UTD. :)

------------------------------------------------------------

The BuildingBridges UTD campaign was a smashing success.  This year's election saw the voting percentage of the student body double, from 6% to 14% (3,000 students).  And with it came a landslide victory for the coalition.  Their hard work coffee-ing late into the night paid off as 24 of 26 senators and both the pres and vice were elected to represent their student body.  Overall that's a >90% success rate!Congrats to the BuildingBridges team!

The website was also a personal success for me.  It felt great to help my sister, and gave me an opportunity to go back to the basics and crank out some really clean code.  I'd like to give my friends a shoutout for spot checking the site before it went live.  [Vinay](http://vinay.io/), [Caroline](http://carol.io/), [Jake](https://jake.su/), [Zach](http://zachtratar.com/), [Grace](http://www.grace.cat/), and [Blaine](http://instagram.com/sslaube/): you guys rock!  Also thanks to Nance for making it super easy for me to get access to the content I needed.  This is the second round of student elections for me- my brother ran in '12, if you want a laugh checkout the code from [his site](https://github.com/jtfairbank/UTD-Student-Elections-2012).

**Stats n Things**

The site went live on Monday March 17th and the elections closed the evening of Friday March 28th, so it was active for a 12 day period.  During that time it got a total of 2,054 visits and 4,537 pageviews, broken up into two roughly equal three day spikes: when we first launched, and during the start of the elections.  The visitors stayed an avery of one and a half minutes, but the distribution in visit times follows a power law with many people leaving quickly (half within the first 10 seconds) but some staying to browse the whole site.  People spent more time on the site around its launch, but less during the election itself (many had probs seen it already).  Facebook promotion of the site played a large roll in its success: there were 435 inlinks from facebook.com and 284 from m.facebook.com.  To me this really underscores a piece of advice which can be applied more generally: the importance of leveraging existing networks to promote new ventures.  We also made it onto google within 9 days, with 18 inlinks from searches.  I'm glad I optimized the site for mobile, since 1/3 of the visitors were using a phone or tablet.  Finally, during the voting week we saw 90 outlinks to UTD's voting website- 2% of the voting population.  Not that'd I'd want to unfairly influence the vote.  ;)  This site sure meets the 100 yards away from any polling place rule.
