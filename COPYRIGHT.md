I do not own anything in `build/lib/`.  Thanks to all the great OSS coders out there.

The senators came up with their own content.

Zac Evans made the killer logo `build/stati/img/logo.jpg`.  I'm pretty sure he took all the photos too (TODO).  You can reach him in at (214) 701-4679, last I heard he was in the Dallas area.

Blaine Smith made `build/static/img/favicon.ico`, based on Zac's logo.  He also colored the hearts (`build/static/heart/`).  What a lad.

This code is (open source) [https://github.com/jtfairbank/UTD-Student-Elections-2014] so feel free to take a peek and use anything that inspires you.  Just not the actual content (logo, images, text/copy), since that's not mine to give away.
